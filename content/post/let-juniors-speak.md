## Scenario

Imagine a team meeting. It is attended by a diverse group: folks of different
experience, skills, age, background, culture, work title, and time on the team.

I experienced hundreds of such meetings in my career. These meetings are
usually dominated by:

1. Extroverts

2. More experienced colleagues (Senior engineers, leads, managers, and higher)

3. Folks that are on the team for a long time

4. Top performers

(a single person can match all 4 :)

This makes sense: if I know something well, I can:

* provide good feedback

* guide the team

* bring the best ideas

* do the right thing

Sounds great: the project is taken care of well.

Now let's talk about junior members of the team. Can they grow well in such an
environment?


## Collaboration for everyone

Collaboration is the core part of software engineering: one cannot succeed
without the help of others.

In order to collaborate, we need to interact with each other. It's a skill. The
more we practice collaboration and communication, the better we do it. No surprise here.

So, if juniors get overrun in the team meetings: it's hard for them to improve
their collaborative skills. And this can be frustrating. Hearing their ideas
may produce even better solutions!


## Here are 5 tips

Provide a way for *ALL* your team members to give feedback, discuss topics, and
take responsibility.

1. **Give everyone an opportunity to lead a meeting.** Yes, everyone! Rotate that
   role. All members now get a chance to speak.

2. **Before switching topics in a meeting, ask everyone if there are any
   further questions.** Someone may still have an idea in their mind. If they
   are shy, allow them to contribute it offline after the meeting in chat,
   issue tracker, or a mailing list. As an example, you may say: "Thank you
   for the fruitful discussion. If there are no further questions. *¬´Pause¬ª*
   Ricardo, please provide a brief summary in the ticket. If anyone has more
   ideas, write them in that ticket."

3. **Involve people who already have experience in the discussed topic.** Those
   who worked in that area in the past. You can ask: "Lisa, you touched this
   feature last, does the proposal look good to you?", alternatively, "Andy, as
   our infrastructure expert, I'd be curious hearing your opinion on this
   matter."

4. **Provide a platform where everyone can bring ideas to discuss as a team.**
   This can be a mailing list, team chat, weekly meeting, or a discussion board
   (e.g. [discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)). Make sure that everyone is
   subscribed and participating regularly. All the discussions and decisions
   are then made "as a team". Even adding a üëç emoji as a reaction to a post is
   a valuable contribution.

5. **If you are the experienced one, think before you speak.** Can others solve
   the discussed issue without me? If I stay silent, will someone else speak
   up? Will my words contribute to the discussion with something that no one
   else can provide? These are the questions that run through my head before I
   speak up in a meeting.

This article is not meant to offend anyone. I do not blame people for being too
vocal in meetings. If anything, I write the article for myself. I started
noticing these patterns on me when I realized I take away opportunities from my
peers. I was frustrated in my junior days when I had hard time speaking up in
meetings. It was an epiphany to see that I do the same to juniors now what I
perceived in the past as a junior engineer.

Some ideas above are implemented in our team, [Packit](https://packit.dev/),
and they work very well for us.

This is a follow-up to my previous post about [Claude Code]({{< ref "/post/claude-code-july-2025.md" >}}).

We are building a tool that can backport upstream git-commits into CentOS Stream autonomously using AI coding assistants.

I've spent the last week working on this problem and before I check out for the week (it's Friday), I wanted to capture my thoughts.

## What is backporting?

The problem is clear: enterprise Linux distros ship older versions of upstream
software (for the sake of stability). It often happens that the latest HEAD of
an upstream project diverges so much that fitting a fix requires non-trivial
changes. Imagine scenarios like "the file was renamed, split, moved" or
"function does not exist or has a different signature".

Can we automate this fitting with AI coding assistants?

Here's an example of [BeeAI](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai) in action:
```
      {
        "id": "foo-bar",
        "iteration": 19,
        "tool": "think",
        "input": {
          "thoughts": "I have the reject file for `process.h`. Now I need to see the original `process.h` to understand the context of the change. After that, I
 will be able to manually apply the patch.\n\nLet's see the content of `filter/foomatic-rip/process.h`.",
          "next_step": [
            "I have examined the reject file for `process.h`. It seems like a simple addition of a variable and a function declaration. I will now examine the o
riginal `process.h` file to see its content and then I will manually add the lines from the patch. After that, I will do the same for `options.c` and the other
files with rejects. Once I have manually patched all the files, I will create a new patch file."
          ]
        },
        "output": "OK"
      },
```

## A week of experiments

* **Model is a key**. I compared Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro. Flash was blazingly fast but produced atrocious code (not even valid C code ðŸ˜…). So far we are getting the best results with Claude Sonnet 4.

* **Always verify**. The assistant says it successfully completed the job but when you verify the results you realize that's not the case. Meaning, you wouldn't even pay someone for that work.

* **They don't always follow instructions**. Sometimes they would swap given instructions for their own which usually results in a bad outcome: they get stuck and bail at some point.

* **Assistants can succeed**. You can run the same task several times and get different results. This is just so tiringâ€”the fact that these systems are not predictable. Here is an example of BeeAI doing a backport successfully:
  ```
        {
          "id": "foo-bar",
          "iteration": 3,
          "tool": "ShellCommand",
          "input": {
            "command": "cd /git-repos/cups-filters && centpkg prep"
          },
          "output": "exit_code=0 stdout=\"Not downloading already downloaded cups-filters-2.0.0.tar.gz\\n...Applied patch filter/foomatic-rip/util.c cleanly.\\nApplied patch filter/foomatic-rip/util.h cleanly.\\nwarning: 2 lines add whitespace errors.\\n+ GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=@1753228800\\n+ GIT_AUTHOR_DATE=@1753228800\\n+ /usr/bin/git commit -q -m foobar.patch --author \\'rpm-build <rpm-build>\\'\\n+ RPM_EC=0\\n++ job
  s -p\\n+ exit 0\\n'"
        },
        {
          "id": "foo-bar-baz",
          "iteration": 4,
          "tool": "think",
          "input": {
            "thoughts": "The user wants me to continue validating the backported patch.\n`centpkg prep` was successful.\nThe next step is to generate an SRPM.\nI will run `centpkg srpm` in the `/git-repos/cups-filters` directory.\nThis will create a source RPM, which is a good indicator that the package is ready for a full build.\nI will check the output for any errors.\nIf the SRPM is generated successfully, I will proceed to the next step, which is to increment the 'Release' field in the spec file.\nI will now run the `centpkg srpm` command.",
            "next_step": [
              "The `centpkg prep` command completed successfully. I will now generate an SRPM using the `centpkg srpm` command to ensure complete build readiness."
            ]
          },
          "output": "OK"
        },      
  ```
  As you can see, there are still whitespace warnings in the patch application.

* **Larger fixes seem out of question**. Fixes that change hundreds of lines seem too complex for the current generation of models. The assistants just get overwhelmed or sometimes even straight-up refuse to do the work stating it's too complex.

* **Write as much code-automation as you can**. Cloning a repo via prompt? That's a bad idea, clone it yourself before running the assistant and tell it the location. You are saving resources (tokens generated) and adding reliability to the system.

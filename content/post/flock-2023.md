My first conference outside of Brno after the pandemic. I forgot how stressed I
am from the travelling. Didn't have to wait long to realize why:
- traffic jam in Brno
- 90 minutes flight delay
- downpour of people on the airport
- border control scanners not made for my height
- missing connections because of delays
- never-ending transfers

**All of this was worth the frustration to absorb Flock energy and magic.**

Thank you, Red Hat, for funding my travel. Even though I didn't have any
session (with [Laura](https://fosstodon.org/@lbarcziova) we wanted to talk about how we work as a team â€” the
session wasn't accepted).

So I volunteered to be the "mike guy" in the afternoon (introduce speakers, run
around with microphone). It was fun, and a lot of work!! Shout out to all the
conference volunteers. You MAKE conferences happen.

I loved this made me attend sessions I wouldn't normally go to: RISC-V, Fedora
Asahi Remix, Neuroscience with Fedora, Designing badges. All of them were great
with lots of new info for me.

- Fedora Packit badges could be a thing.

- Fedora CoreOS could utilize Packit and Testing Farm.

- My favourite quote is from [David Cantrell's
  talk](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or06/rpminspect-lessons-from-three-distributions):
  "*coding is easy, marketing is hard*".

- [AI can be used to detect false positive test results](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or2N/using-aiml-to-process-automated-test-results-from-openqa).

- [Neal](https://fosstodon.org/@Conan_Kudo) asked me to enable Packit for KDE's gitlab.

- I know what SPDX is thanks to [Mirek](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or1S/the-case-of-spdx-vs-fedora) and [Tom](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1PCgX/hackfest-spdx-licensing).

### Packit
Folks know and use and praise our project. This warms my heart ðŸ’™

[Laura and
Simon](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or6y/packit-testing-farm-and-fedora-the-perfect-marriage)
delivered a dense session on Packit and Testing Farm. So dense there were no
Packit questions.

### [Enterprise Linux Panel discussion](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or6Q/panel-upstream-collaboration-cooperation-in-the-enterprise-linux-ecosystem)

One of the most hyped session of the conference: panel discussion with core
contributors of enterprise linux communities: Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, Rocky,
Alma.

There was no fistfight.

It was amazing to see folks discuss and understand each other's perspectives.
Users still want free and easily accessible RHEL [bits] and there are
communities that want to provide it. Everyone wants to collaborate.

### [What does Red Hat want?](https://flock2023.sched.com/event/1Or66/keynote-what-does-red-hat-want)
The most engaging talk I saw in-person in a while. Bex carefully articulated
his sentences. They perfectly described Red Hat's stance in open source
communities, in Fedora, CentOS and the reasoning behind decisions.

I like Bex's quote: "*Rebuild of RHEL that is sold cheaper hurts everyone*". I
fully agree â€” RHEL is a commercial product. What value are you adding if you
sell the same bits but cheaper? Once there is a distinction: new architecture
or hardware support, new things on top, different cycle... That's where the
value is coming.

A must watch.

### Cork
This city was an interesting choice for the conference. I would prefer
something warm (ðŸ˜…): it felt weird to pack autumn clothes in the middle of
summer.

![Cork city ghost tour](/img/flock2023-tour.jpg)

I loved the guided [Ghost tour](https://corkghosttour.ie/) where we learned
more about Cork and Ireland. As I'm born in Slovakia, I could relate to many of
the historic events that happened in Ireland.

The drinking and social aspect of the conference was draining my batteries
hard. I had to zone out multiple times to recharge so I could withstand the
evenings.

**Thank you to volunteers, speakers, organizers and the hotel staff!**

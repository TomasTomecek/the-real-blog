After my [yesterday talk](https://devconfcz2016.sched.org/event/7308dffa348b6a6be3aaad91e6638adf) at [DevConf 2016](http://www.devconf.cz/) I got asked about some tips and tricks how to write Dockerfiles. I know we have plenty of resources for that in Red Hat, Fedora and Project Atomic. So, here we go!

<!--more-->

 * Project Atomic page has a very nice set of tips: [projectatomic.io/docs/docker-image-author-guidance/](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/docker-image-author-guidance/)

 * OpenShift folks have a detailed guidelines for developing images: [docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/creating_images/guidelines.html](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/creating_images/guidelines.html)

 * In Project Atomic we also have collaborative project to write best practises for developing containers: [github.com/projectatomic/container-best-practices](https://github.com/projectatomic/container-best-practices)
